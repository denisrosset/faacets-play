The database is divided in three parts:

- the `canonical` folder contains Bell-like inequalities in the canonical form,
  numbered from 0, in a form suitable for references,
- the `pubs` folder provides the forms of Bell-like inequalities that have been
  published in the litterature, staying as close as possible to the notation of the
  original paper,
- the `solved` folder contains some completely solved local polytopes.

All equivalent inequalities under standard transforms (relabellings, notation,
liftings, tensor products) are cross referenced to a single `canonical` reference.

The data is stored in the human readable [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)
text format, and the most recent version of the database can be downloaded from the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/denisrosset/faacets-data).
