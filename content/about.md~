50 years ago, John S. Bell introduced in his paper "On the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox" probabilistic inequalities which can be violated by quantum systems. Since then, many more inequalities of this kind -- commonly referred to as Bell or Bell-like inequalities -- have been discovered, and have proved useful in various contexts, from fundamental studies of nature, to applications for secured communication, etc...

These inequalities, however, are spread out in the whole specialized litterature, often under different names (e.g. *nonlocal games*) and written in their own unique way. This makes it hard to access, compare, or study them. Moreover, little general-purpose information is available about questions related to Bell inequalities.

This website aims at providing a platform to foster exchange on Bell inequalities. It includes a few [short texts](/#highlights) written by specialists that provide highlights on themes related to Bell inequalities, as well as a [compendium](/db) of known Bell-like inequalities.

The website relies on a software coded for the occasion, which takes care of the hard work needed to relate Bell inequalities to a single unified inequality format. The algorithm used by this software is described in this [paper (in preparation)](http://www.arxiv.org/). A version of the software is also available [here](http://code.faacets.com) to use as standalone directly in e.g. Matlab.

This website and all its content is open source, and modifiable by anyone. To contribute to the compendium with an inequality which is not yet incorpoprated (check you whether this is the case or not with the [What the facet](/wtf) function), follow the instructions provided here (in preparation). It is also easy to add information about the inequalities which are already present in the collection (e.g. an interesting bound, or property of special interest). For this follow the instructions here (in preparation). Finally, it is also possible for anyone to add features on the main software. For this, access to the code directly on [github](https://github.com/denisrosset/faacets).
