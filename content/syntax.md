Faacets supports three notations:

- terms specified using full probabilities, writing `P(abc...|xyz...)`,
- terms in the Collins-Gisin notation, by specifying the parties `P_AB(ab|xy)`,
- correlator terms using the notation `< Ax By ... >`,
with the input and output numbering starting at 1.

Expressions can be entered using rational coefficients before each term.
Constant terms, parentheses, operators such as `<=` or `>=` are not supported.
